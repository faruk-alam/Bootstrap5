Bootstrap Typography:

Working with Headings
You can define all HTML headings, <h1> through <h6> â€” In the same way you define in simple HTML document. 
You can also utilize the heading classes .h1 through .h6 on other elements, if you want to apply the style 
on element's text same as headings.

Display Headings
Bootstrap also provides display headings that can be used when you need a heading to stand out. Display 
headings are displayed in larger font-size but lighter font-weight.
Six different display headings are available.

Working with Paragraphs
Bootstrap's global default font-size is 1rem (typically 16px), with a line-height of 1.5 (typically 24px),
which is applied to the <body> element as well as all the paragraphs i.e. the <p> elements. In addition to
that margin-bottom of 1rem is also applied to all the paragraphs.

You can also make a paragraph stand out by adding the class .lead on it.

Color
Bootstrap is supported by an extensive color system that themes our styles and components. This enables 
more comprehensive customization and extension for any project.
Colors are the powerful method of conveying important information in website design.
Bootstrap has handful of emphasis utility classes that can be used for this purpose such as showing 
success message in green color, warning or error message in red color, etc.

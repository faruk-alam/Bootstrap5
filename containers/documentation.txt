Containers
Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given 
device or viewport.
How they work
Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. 
Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, 
most layouts do not require a nested container.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint
The table below illustrates how each container’s max-width compares to the original .container and .container-fluid 
across each breakpoint.

See them in action and compare them in our Grid example.

Extra small
<576px	Small
≥576px	Medium
≥768px	Large
≥992px	X-Large
≥1200px	XX-Large
≥1400px
.container	100%	540px	720px	960px	1140px	1320px
.container-sm	100%	540px	720px	960px	1140px	1320px
.container-md	100%	100%	720px	960px	1140px	1320px
.container-lg	100%	100%	100%	960px	1140px	1320px
.container-xl	100%	100%	100%	100%	1140px	1320px
.container-xxl	100%	100%	100%	100%	100%	1320px
.container-fluid	100%	100%	100%	100%	100%	100%

Responsive containers
Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, 
after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints. For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start 
until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, lg, xl, and xxl.

<div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>
Fluid containers
Use .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

<div class="container-fluid">
  ...
</div>

Creating Buttons with Bootstrap:
Buttons are the integral part of a website and application. They are used for various purposes like, submit 
or reset an HTML form, performing interactive actions such as showing or hiding something on a web page on 
click of the button, redirecting user to another page, and so on. Bootstrap provides a quick and easy way 
to create and customize the buttons.

Bootstrap Button Styles
Different classes are available in Bootstrap for styling the buttons as well as to indicate the different 
states or semantic. Button styles can be applied to any element. However, it is applied normally to the <a>,
<input>, and <button> elements for the best rendering.

Changing the Sizes of Buttons
Bootstrap gives you option further to scaling a button up or down.
To make buttons larger add an extra class .btn-lg to the buttons,
Similarly, to make buttons smaller add an extra class .btn-sm to the buttons.

Outline buttons
In need of a button, but not the hefty background colors they bring? Replace the default modifier classes 
with the .btn-outline-* ones to remove all background images and colors on any button.

Bootstrap Disabled Buttons
Sometimes we need to disable a button for certain reasons, for example, a user in case is not eligible to 
perform this particular action, or we want to ensure that user should performed all other required actions 
before proceed to this particular action. Let's see how to do that.

Buttons created through <button> or <input> tag can be disabled by adding the disabled attribute to the 
respective element.
Disabled buttons have pointer-events: none applied to, preventing hover and active states from triggering.

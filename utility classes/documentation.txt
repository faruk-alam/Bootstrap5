Utilities for layout:
For faster mobile-friendly and responsive development, Bootstrap includes dozens of utility classes for 
showing, hiding, aligning, and spacing content.
Margin and padding
Use the margin and padding spacing utilities to control how elements and components are spaced and sized. 
Bootstrap includes a six-level scale for spacing utilities, based on a 1rem value default $spacer variable. 
Choose values for all viewports (e.g., .me-3 for margin-right: 1rem in LTR), or pick responsive variants 
to target specific viewports (e.g., .me-md-3 for margin-right: 1rem —in LTR— starting at the md breakpoint).

Borders
Use border utilities to quickly style the border and border-radius of an element. Great for images, buttons,
 or any other element.
